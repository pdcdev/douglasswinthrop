        <div class="description">
            <p>Douglass Winthrop Advisors, LLC was founded in 2000 by Robert Douglass and Jay Winthrop to manage assets for high-net-worth individuals, 
                families, trusts and endowments. From a modest beginning with only a few clients the firm now manages approximately $1 billion across more than 200 accounts. 
                Our professional staff has grown to include Lea Paine Highet, a Certified Financial Planner with considerable wealth management expertise, 
                as well as investment committee members Charlie Howard, Chars Crane, Bryce O’Brien, Grant Winthrop, Josh Huffard, Bowdy Train and Oak Strawbridge. 
                Our professional team brings more than 150 years of collective investment experience to the daily rigors of overseeing our clients’ portfolios. 
                Douglass Winthrop's success is due to its long-term record of growing and preserving clients' assets, its reputation for trust gained by always 
                putting clients' interests first and its ability to attract talented partners. We believe this simple, elegant approach to business 
                will continue to serve our clients and our firm well for many years to come. In April 2012 Douglass Winthrop moved into new headquarters 
                at 535 Fifth Avenue to accommodate recent and future growth. We opened branch offices in Boston in late 2013 and in Washington, DC in early 2014.
